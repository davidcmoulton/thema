## Quick Start

```sh
npm install @stencila/thema
```

```css
/* myStyleSheet.css */
@import '@stencila/thema/dist/stencila/styles.css';
```

```js
/* myJavaScript.js */
@import '@stencila/thema/dist/stencila';
```

## Available Themes

- `stencila`: A custom designed theme suited for long-form reading,
  specifically research papers. It strives to deliver an optimal reading
  experience whilst giving figures and other media objects as much room as
  possible.
- `eLife`: Inspired by the eLife website, this theme provides as
  close of an approximation as possible for solely semantically structured
  documents such as Markdown.

## Theme Structure

There are two primary files inside each theme folder. The naming of these two
files is important, and they must not be changed since they are referred to
from `encoda`.

- `styles.css`: CSS and visual styles specific to the theme. We use PostCSS
  to compile the CSS, this is done to utilize PostCSS utilities such as
  autoprefixing vendor flags to selectors, and writing nested selectors.
- `index.ts`: Written in TypeScript, this file is loaded asynchronously. It is
  used to progressively enhance the theme with things like syntax highlighting
  of code blocks.

## Develop

### Prerequisites

- [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com)
- [`git`](https://git-scm.com)

### Getting started

The best way to get started is to develop CSS and JS for a theme with the live updating demo running.

Clone this repository,

```sh
git clone git@github.com:stencila/thema.git
cd thema
```

Install dependencies,

```sh
npm install
```

Run the development server,

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:1234/index.html in your browser to view the demo.

### Generated code

Some files in the `src` directory are generated, including:

- `src/themes/themes.ts`: from the list of sub-folders in the `themes` folder
- `src/examples/examples.ts`: from the functions defined in `generate/examples.ts`
- `src/examples/*`: files generated by those functions, usually using the `@stencila/encoda` package
- `src/selectors.css`: custom selectors from the JSON Schema in the `@stencila/schema` package
- `src/shared/styles/mathjax.css`: MathJax CSS from the `mathjax-node` package

Run `npm run generate` when you add new themes, examples or upgrade one of those upstream packages. In particular, when Encoda is upgraded it is important to regenerate HTML for the examples; `npm run generate` is called after `npm install` to ensure this.

### Testing

We use visual regression testing powered by [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com), [Argos](https://www.argos-ci.com), and [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io).

As part of the continuous integration for this repository, for each push,

1. themes are [built on Travis](https://travis-ci.org/stencila/thema),
2. examples rendered in a browser running on Sauce Labs,
3. screenshots taken and [uploaded to Argos](https://www.argos-ci.com/stencila/thema/builds).

To run these tests locally, run `npm run test`.
By default Webdriver will try to run the tests using Chrome, but you can switch to Firefox by setting an `TEST_BROWSER=firefox` environment variable.

When testing locally, there are three screenshot folders to be aware of inside the `test/screenshots` directory:

- `reference`: These are the baseline screenshots. To generate them, make sure your Git branch is free of any changes, and run `npm test`.
- `local`: These are screenshots generated by Webdriver tests, and will be compared to those found in the `reference` directory.
- `diff`: If any discrepancies are found between the `reference` and `local` screenshots, the differences will be highlighted and saved to this directory.

## Technical Notes

We use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) to compile this module. One of the
plugins we utilize to generate transportable and offline-viewable documents
is [`parcel-plugin-url-loader`](https://github.com/stencila/parcel-plugin-url-loader)
to base64 encode and inline binary assets found in the CSS. This has the
tradeoff that it leads to much larger page sizes, but the ability to generate
stylesheets without inlining assets is on the roadmap.

We rely on many tools and services for which we are grateful ‚ù§ to their developers and contributors for all their time and energy.
