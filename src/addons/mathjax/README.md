# MathJax addon

Targets MathJax HTML generated by Encoda for `MathFragment` and `MathBlock` nodes.

This addon is recommended if there are likely
to be any math content in documents that your theme targets.

Note that this addon does not include any of MathJax's Javascript for rendering math content in TeX. That is because Encoda does the pre-rendering as part of it's encoding to HTML.
