# Examples

👋 This folder provides examples content to test themes against.

These examples are best generated by Encoda since Thema targets the HTML that it generates. Having said that, you _could_ generate examples using other tools 🛠️, or write it by hand ✍️.

## Adding new examples

To generate new examples using Encoda, either use a global install of `encoda`, or `npm link` to a local copy:

```bash
npm link @stencila/encoda
```

Then create an HTML file for your example e.g.

```bash
npx encoda convert https://elifesciences.org/articles/49574v2 article-drosophila.html
```

Once you have created an example:

1. add the Bash command you used to `generate.sh` in this folder.

2. add an entry for it in `index.ts` in this folder

3. add an entry for it in `../index.html` for the content dropdown

## Regenerating examples

You can regenerate existing examples using:

```bash
./generate.sh
```
