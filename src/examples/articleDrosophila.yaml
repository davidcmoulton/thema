        Male courtship is provoked by perception of a potential mate. In
        addition, the likelihood and intensity of courtship are influenced by
        recent mating experience, which affects sexual drive. Using

        ) neurons, regulate courtship through affecting courtship drive.
        Disrupting NPF signaling produces sexually hyperactive males, which are
        resistant to sexual satiation, and whose courtship is triggered by
        sub-optimal stimuli. We found that NPF

        To mate is a critical decision that sexually reproductive animals must
        make to ensure propagation of their species. Although courtship is an
        innate behavior that can be evoked mostly by stimulatory cues emitted
        from a conspecific of the opposite sex, the intensity of courtship is
        largely under control of animal’s internal drive state, which is
        dictated in part by sexual satiation or deprivation.

        Male flies exhibit escalated levels of courtship following periods of

        courtship when external sensory cues from potential mates match with

Samples were washed three times with PBST before applying secondary antibodies for 3 hr at 25 °C in darkness. After washing three times with PBST, the samples were mounted with VectaShield (Vector Labs) on glass slides. The primary antibodies were chicken anti-GFP (1:1000, Invitrogen, A-10262), rabbit anti-DsRed (1:1000, Clontech, 632496), mouse nc82 (1:250, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), rabbit anti-FruM (1:10000) ("
