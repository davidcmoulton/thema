        Antibodies developed for research and clinical applications may exhibit
        suboptimal stability, expressibility, or affinity. Existing optimization
        strategies focus on surface mutations, whereas natural affinity
        maturation also introduces mutations in the antibody core,
        simultaneously improving stability and affinity. To systematically map
        the mutational tolerance of an antibody variable fragment (Fv), we
        performed yeast display and applied deep mutational scanning to an
        anti-lysozyme antibody and found that many of the affinity-enhancing
        mutations clustered at the variable light-heavy chain interface, within
        the antibody core. Rosetta design combined enhancing mutations, yielding
        a variant with tenfold higher affinity and substantially improved
        stability. To make this approach broadly accessible, we developed
        AbLIFT, an automated web server that designs multipoint core mutations
        to improve contacts between specific Fv light and heavy chains (

        ). We applied AbLIFT to two unrelated antibodies targeting the human
        antigens VEGF and QSOX1. Strikingly, the designs improved stability,
        affinity, and expression yields. The results provide proof-of-principle
        for bypassing laborious cycles of antibody engineering through automated
        computational affinity and stability design.

        High-affinity natural antibodies are generated through an iterative
        process of mutation and selection for antigen binding known as affinity
        maturation. Affinity maturation also selects antibodies that exhibit
        higher stability and expressibility [

        ]. In recent decades, synthetic antibody repertoires have been widely
        adopted in antibody discovery and optimization, providing greater
        control over the selection process than animal immunization. In this
        approach, a library of antibody variable fragments (Fv) is displayed,
        for instance on yeast cells, and screened to select high-affinity
        binders or to improve the affinity of existing antibodies [

        To boost antibody stability and affinity, computational design methods
        have been developed. These have focused on the Fv
        complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), which are typically in
        direct contact with the antigen. Some methods, for instance, improved
        electrostatic complementarity with the antigen [

        ones in the CDRs, they are more likely to retain the intricate structure

        with affinity-enhancing mutations in the CDRs that were obtained through
        other optimization strategies. The antibody core, however, is a large

        itself. The large improvements in the reliability and breadth of
        detection of affinity-enhancing mutations through deep mutational
        scanning inspired us to revisit the challenge of accurately predicting
        the effects of core mutations on antibody affinity and stability. Deep
        mutational scanning guided us in uncovering a cluster of core positions
        at the light-heavy chain (vL-vH) interface where many affinity-enhancing
        mutations occurred. We then used these systematic data to establish
        general rules for computational design of antibody Fvs with improved
        vL-vH interactions; we implemented these rules as an automated method,
        called AbLIFT and made it available through a web server (

        ). AbLIFT designs exhibited striking gains in affinity, stability, and
        expressibility in two unrelated antibodies that target the human disease
        markers Vascular-Epidermal Growth Factor (VEGF) and the enzyme Quiescin
        Sulfhydryl Oxidase 1 (QSOX1).

        ). This cluster of affinity-enhancing mutations in the vL-vH interface
        is intriguing for four reasons: (1) the vL-vH interface mediates the
        assembly of the Fv from the two antibody chains, and mutations in this
        region have the potential to also enhance stability through improved Fv
        assembly [

        antibody generation is a random process which may result in suboptimal
        vL-vH interfaces, flexibility in the antigen-binding site [

        and may not be fully optimized in the course of natural affinity
        maturation [

        that simultaneously improve stability and affinity in both natural and
        engineered antibodies.

        Combining mutations in densely packed protein cores, such as the vL-vH
        interface, is challenging, however, because inadvertently introduced
        voids, steric overlaps, or mispaired polar amino acid side-chains can
        lead to protein instability, misfolding, and aggregation [

        ]. We, therefore, asked whether the mutational-tolerance map could guide
        Rosetta design in finding improved multipoint mutants at the vL-vH
        interface. In preliminary calculations starting from the lysozyme-bound
        D44.1 structure (PDB entry: 1MLC), we restricted Rosetta combinatorial
        design to the eight positions and 38 identities (including the wild type
        identities) at these positions that showed at least threefold enrichment
        relative to D44.1 according to the mutational-tolerance map (

        ). The resulting design, however, comprised only three conservative
        mutations, suggesting that the dense packing and backbone rigidity at
        the vL-vH interface restricted sequence optimization. We, therefore,
        repeated design calculations but this time excluded the wild type
        identities at the eight positions, forcing the design of an optimal
        combination of mutations only from those that were substantially
        enriched in deep mutational scanning. We iterated sequence design and
        backbone and sidechain minimization to promote the acceptance of even

        for mutational-tolerance mapping. To achieve this goal, we exploited the
        large experimental dataset of the D44.1 mutational tolerance map,
        comprising 2,294 point mutations, for training. At each of the mutated
        D44.1 Fv positions, we used Rosetta to compute the changes to
        native-state energy due to each of the 19 amino acid mutations (ÎÎ
      - type: Emphasis
        content:

        ). Using a multiple-sequence alignment of homologous Fvs, we
        additionally computed each point mutationâs evolutionary-conservation
        score, as represented in a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) [

        ]. These two computed parameters provide complementary predictions of
        mutational tolerance: the former predicts the impact of a mutation on
        native-state stability and the latter discriminates between
        evolutionarily tolerated mutations and those that have been purged by
        evolution. The use of these two parameters has recently led to
        substantial improvement in design accuracy in binder and enzyme design
        challenges in our laboratory [

        maps for any antibody Fv.

        We next sought to develop a general and fully automated design protocol
        for improving molecular interactions across the vL-vH interface. AbLIFT
        starts by computing a mutational-tolerance map at the vL-vH interface
        using the approach described above; it then exhaustively enumerates the
        multipoint combinations of tolerated mutations; ranks them by energy,
        and selects low-energy variants for experimental testing. This algorithm
        resembles our recently described FuncLib method for designing
        functionally diverse enzyme repertoires [

        ], with the key differences that AbLIFT is applied to the core of
        obligatory binding surfaces rather than to solvent-exposed surfaces and
        most importantly, AbLIFT does not require an initial design round of
        protein stabilization.

        Our study demonstrates that improved interactions across the vL-vH
        interface may result in substantial optimization of a range of essential
        parameters for antibody development, including expressibility,
        stability, and affinity. The automated AbLIFT strategy enables the
        design of cooperative networks of multipoint mutations in the antibody
        core that are likely to be inaccessible to experimental affinity
        maturation processes since these latter methods select mutations in a
        stepwise manner. Since AbLIFT impacts the antibody core and does not
        alter the structure of the antigen-binding site, the designed mutations
        cooperate with surface mutations identified through conventional
        antibody-engineering processes to further increase affinity and
        stability. AbLIFT may be particularly beneficial in antibodies, such as
        G6 and h492.1, which were the product of antibody-engineering approaches
        that might compromise antibody structural integrity, resulting in
        reduced affinity or stability. Moreover, antibody structure-prediction
        methods now often produce atomically accurate models at the vL-vH
        interface (though still not at the CDR H3) [

        ], suggesting that by restricting design to the framework regions,
        AbLIFT may in some cases enable antibody optimisation even in the
        absence of an experimental structure. We note, however, that AbLIFT
        considers only phylogenetic information and molecular energetics and
        disregards immunogenicity, which may be an important consideration in
        antibodies developed for clinical use. To address this concern, the
        AbLIFT web server enables complete control over the design sequence
        space and can be used to eliminate mutations with immunogenic potential.

        The surprisingly broad ability of vL-vH design to optimize antibody
        properties is consistent with the Colman interface-adaptor hypothesis,

        ]. Flexibility, however, might come at a cost, since an Fv that exhibits
        flexible vL-vH pairing may occupy multiple molecular states that compete
        with the binding-competent state, thus lowering antigen-binding
        affinity. Flexibility may moreover result in misfolding or transient
        dissociation of the two variable chains, resulting in terminal
        aggregation or degradation by the cellular proteostasis machinery,
        thereby lowering expression yields. In extreme cases, poorly defined
        packing at the vL-vH interface can lead to substantial rearrangements of
        the antibody variable domain during binding [

        ], and such rearrangements could lower antigen-binding affinity and
        specificity. Therefore, while the interface-adaptor hypothesis neatly
        explains why flexibility at the vL-vH interface is advantageous in early
        steps of antibody selection, broad specificity and marginal vL-vH
        interface stability become liabilities in later stages of antibody
        development into research or therapeutic tools. We anticipate that
        AbLIFT will have a wide scope to automatically and reliably improve
        stability, solubility, expressibility, affinity, and structural
        integrity in numerous antibodies in which these important properties are
        compromised.

(green) a random set of multipoint mutants at 30 vL-vH interface (all interface positions were allowed), where any of the 19 amino acid mutations was allowed at each mutated position. In both sets, the same number of multipoint mutants was analyzed, and the same distribution of the number of mutations relative to G6 was implemented. 37% of the multipoint mutants had energies that were more favorable than G6, whereas less than 0.03% of the random mutants had more favorable energies than G6. Thus computational mutation tolerance mapping enriches for improved mutants by over 1,100-fold relative to random multipoint mutations.'
